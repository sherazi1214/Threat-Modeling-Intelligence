# Threat-Modeling-Intelligence

## 1. Threat Modeling
**English:**
Threat modeling is the process of identifying, understanding, and prioritizing potential security threats to a system or organization, and finding ways to reduce or stop them before they happen.

**Roman Urdu:**
Threat modeling ek process hai jisme hum possible security threats ko identify (pehchante) hain, unka analysis karte hain, aur unko kam ya khatam karne ke liye plan banate hain.

## Factors Involved in Threat Modeling
**English:**

Assets – What you are protecting (data, systems, resources)

Threats – Potential attacks or dangers

Vulnerabilities – Weak points in the system

Attack Vectors – Ways an attacker could get in

Impact – Damage if the threat happens

Likelihood – Chances of it happening

**Urdu:**

Assets – Kya protect karna hai (data, system, resources)

Threats – Possible attacks ya khatre

Vulnerabilities – System ki kamzori

Attack Vectors – Attack ka raasta

Impact – Nuksaan kitna hoga

Likelihood – Hony ka chance kitna hai

## Threat Modeling Approaches
**English:**

STRIDE – Looks at threats like Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege.

PASTA – Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (7-stage model).

OCTAVE – Risk-based approach focusing on organization’s security needs.

Attack Trees – Diagram showing how attacks could be carried out.

VAST – Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling for DevOps environments.
**Urdu:**

STRIDE – Threat types ka breakdown (Spoofing, Tampering, etc.)

PASTA – Step-by-step attack simulation process

OCTAVE – Risk-based planning approach

Attack Trees – Diagram jisme attack ka pura plan dikhaya jata hai

VAST – Visual aur Agile model DevOps ke liye

## 2. Threat Intelligence
**English:**
Threat intelligence is the collection and analysis of information about current and potential cyber threats so organizations can prepare and respond effectively.
**Urdu:**
Threat intelligence ka matlab hai cyber threats ke bare me information collect aur analyze karna taake organization ready ho aur attack ka samna kar sake.

## Factors Involved in Threat Intelligence
**English:**

Data Collection – Gathering threat data from multiple sources

Analysis – Understanding patterns and behaviors

Relevance – Checking if the threat applies to your environment

Timeliness – Getting the intel before the attack happens

Actionability – Being able to use it for defense

**Urdu:**

Data Collection – Alag alag sources se data lena

Analysis – Data ka meaning samajhna

Relevance – Dekhna kya ye hamare system pe apply hota hai

Timeliness – Attack hone se pehle information milna

Actionability – Is information ka use karke defense karna

## Threat Intelligence Sources
**English:**

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) – Publicly available info (websites, news, social media)

Internal Data – Logs, past incidents, internal monitoring

Commercial Threat Feeds – Paid subscription services

ISACs/ISAOs – Industry-specific sharing centers

Dark Web Monitoring – Checking hacker forums and marketplaces
 **Urdu:**

OSINT – Public info (websites, news, social media)

Internal Data – Apne system ke logs aur records

Commercial Feeds – Paid services jo latest threat data deti hain

ISACs/ISAOs – Industry ke liye special info sharing groups

Dark Web Monitoring – Hacker forums aur hidden marketplaces check karna
